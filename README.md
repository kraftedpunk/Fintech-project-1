Project Team Members: Chris Diaz, Jaime Leon, Griselda Ramos and Yutika Misra

Due to the spike of the cryptocurrency market (aka Crypto-boom), many investors have been pivoting away from traditional stock and bond portfolios and allocating their assets into various cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency by nature is high risk, high reward, yet the question remains: what coin should I invest in?
Many investors want to invest in crypto however do not have the time or resources to do the proper due diligence necessary to create a diversified "crypto" portfolio. Our project is focused on developing two crypto-currency portfolios: conservative and aggressive. Our goal is to present analysis for the investor to choose a uniquely designed portfolio that best fits their risk tolerance and investment needs.

Omni_Krypto_10 is separated into two distinct portfolios: Omni-Krypto Blue (Conservative and and Omni-Krypto Green (Aggressive).

We have analyzed the coins listed below and allocated them on to each portfolio based standard deviation and correlation.
Binance, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Iota, Litecoin, Monero, Stellar and XPR
Monte Carlo simulations and expect returns will be provided for both portfolios.
